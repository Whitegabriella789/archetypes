# Package overview

The Archetypes package is designed to provide a set of algorithms for performing Archetypal Analysis (AA). The goal of the package is to make AA more accessible and easier to implement for Python developers. This package provides a set of functions for data preprocessing, archetypal analysis, and visualization of the results.

## What is Archetypal Analysis?

Archetypal Analysis is a data analysis method that aims to identify a small number of archetypes, which are extreme examples of the data set.

Specifically, each data point will be represented as a linear combination of the archetypes. Moreover, each archetype will be represented as a linear combination of the original data points.

Therefore, these archetypes will lie in the convex hull of the data set, being the most representative examples this.

## Benefits of using Archetypal Analysis

Archetypal Analysis has several benefits when it comes to describing data. Here are some examples:

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: AA can reduce the dimensionality of the data by identifying a small set of archetypes that can explain most of the variability in the data set.
- **Interpretability**: The archetypes generated by AA can be interpreted as characteristic examples of the data set, which can provide insights into the underlying patterns and structures in the data.
- **Outlier Detection**: AA can be used to identify outliers in the data set by detecting observations that cannot be well represented by a linear combination of the archetypes.
- **Clustering**: AA can be used for clustering by partitioning the data set into groups that are well-represented by different subsets of the archetypes.
Overall, the "archetypes" package aims to provide a powerful and flexible tool for exploring and understanding complex data sets using Archetypal Analysis.
