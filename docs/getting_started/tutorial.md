# Tutorials

In this section, we provide a couple of tutorials that cover different aspects of Archetypal Analysis (AA) using the Archetypes package. These walkthroughs are designed to help you get started with AA, understand its benefits, and demonstrate how to use the Archetypes package to perform various types of analyses.

## Introduction to Archetype Analysis

Archetype Analysis (AA) is a data analysis method that identifies a small number of archetypes, which are extreme examples of a dataset. These archetypes can be used to describe the dataset and perform tasks such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, and outlier detection.

### Benefits of Archetype Analysis:

* **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reduces data complexity by identifying key archetypes.

* **Interpretability:** Provides insights into data patterns through characteristic examples.

* **Outlier Detection:** Identifies observations that cannot be well represented by archetypes.

* **Clustering:** Partitions data into groups represented by different subsets of archetypes.

## BiArchetype Analysis

BiArchetype Analysis (BiAA) extends the concept of Archetype Analysis by analyzing two distinct but related sets of archetypes. This can provide a more comprehensive understanding of complex data structures.

### Advantages of BiArchetype Analysis:

* **Enhanced Interpretability:** Analyzes two sets of archetypes, providing deeper insights.

* **Better Representation:** Captures more complex data structures by considering relationships between two sets of archetypes.

* **Improved Clustering:** Partitions data into more meaningful clusters based on two sets of archetypes.
